When in an active design sprint, make sure to schedule time to let your mind wander, preferably somewhere away from any screens. Take a walk. Relax. Let your subconscious do some of the work. 

I often find that if I plant a design challenge into the back of my mind long before I need to actually touch pixels, when I actually do start I find myself on the right track very quickly. At the very least, I have sketchy ideas ready to go. I don't experience any writer's block; no staring at a blank screen and unsure where to begin. I'm fully ready.

Inviting developers into the early stages of design exploration will always result in a wider swath of ideas. Good developers should be up to date with new or unused tech possibilities and that knowledge is invaluable to the success of a product. Not only that, but allowing developers the opportunity to build tech their excited about adds energy and vibrancy to the team. Designers do not own the product roadmap. They are not *creatives* in any way developers are not.

Design --> Any action taken to systematically influence or control the actions of others. 

Design can be good, bad, moral, unethical, helpful, frustrating, etc. 

Design, as a word, can be frustratingly vague. For instance, nearly anyone at anytime working in any capacity can be said to be *designing* their actions. But yet *designer* is a real career path on its own. It's a matter of focus and attention.

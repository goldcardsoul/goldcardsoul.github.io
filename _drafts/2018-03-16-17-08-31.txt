When taking a job as a designer in a product role, you should suppress any desire to leave a personal mark on the product. You should hope to leave the company with as few traces of your own opinions reflected in the work. 

This is, of course, impossible. At the end of your stint on a product, you'll be able to look back and recognize yourself in the work. It's unavoidable. Even so, the *attempt* to leave no footprints in the snow is what's important. 

There must be a better way to describe this. It's a zen lesson.
